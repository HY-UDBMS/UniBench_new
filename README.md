# UniBench 2.0: A benchmark for multi-model databases
The [UniBench project](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/unified-database-management-systems-udbms/unibench-towards-benchmarking-multi-model-dbms) aims to develop a generic benchmark for a holistic evaluation of multi-model database systems (MMDS), which are able to support multiple data models such as documents, graph, and key-value models in a single back-end. UniBench consists of a set of mixed data models that mimics a social commerce application, which covers data models including JSON, XML, key-value, tabular,  graph, and RDF. The UniBench workload consists of a set of complex read-only queries and read-write transactions that involve at least two data models.
